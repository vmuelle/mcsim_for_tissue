#Introduction

This projct helps to simulate the properties of skin tissue regarding interference with light.
For the simulation MCML.exe is used.
This executable takes a file with input parameters. 
These Parameters are derived from Moco, New insight into the origin of remote PPG signals in visible light and infrared(2018).


#Execution

An overview on the solution to the task is given in the matlab live script main.mlx.
Here, the parameter calculation, the simulation execution and visualization of the results is shown step by step.
